# City Temperature Analysis Project

## Overview :-

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a historical city temperature dataset using Python and Pandas. 
The objective is to clean the data, compute meaningful statistics, and identify extreme temperature patterns.

## Data Processing :-
The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and preprocessed by removing invalid temperature values (-99),
which represent missing or incorrect data entries. This ensures the analysis is performed on clean and reliable data.

## Analysis Performed 
### The project includes:

1. Extracting and previewing key time-related columns (Month and Year).

2. Calculating the average temperature per year to observe long-term trends.

3. Calculating the average temperature per month to analyze seasonal patterns.

4. Identifying extremely hot days by applying a threshold of 100°F.

5. Counting and displaying records of days that exceed this extreme temperature threshold.


## Key Concepts Demonstrated :-

* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

* Data Grouping and Aggregation

* Conditional Filtering

* Basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Working with real-world datasets using Pandas

## Tools & Technologies :-
Python
Pandas

Conclusion
This project highlights foundational data analysis skills, including handling missing data, performing grouped statistical analysis,
and extracting insights from structured datasets. It is suitable as a beginner-level data analysis portfolio project.
